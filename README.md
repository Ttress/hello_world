First repository

Just a fledgling Web Developer getting into the world of coding. Just finished The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0 on Udemy taught by Rob Percival. I am now moving onto creating my own projects while also starting the Odin Project Course and a Harvard CS50 course released for free online. Looking forward to learning more.
